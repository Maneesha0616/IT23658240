# IT23658240


## Project Overview

This project contains automated test cases for testing a Singlish-to-Sinhala translation web application using Playwright. The test suite covers functional and UI test scenarios as per the assignment requirements.

**Target Application:** https://www.swifttranslator.com/

## Test Coverage

The automated test suite includes:
- **24+ Positive Functional Test Cases** - Scenarios where the system correctly converts Singlish to Sinhala
- **10+ Negative Functional Test Cases** - Scenarios where the system fails or behaves incorrectly
- **1 UI Test Case** - Testing real-time output update behavior

### Test Categories Covered:
1. Sentence structures (simple, compound, complex)
2. Interrogative and imperative forms
3. Positive and negative sentence forms
4. Daily language usage (greetings, requests, responses)
5. Word combinations and phrase patterns
6. Grammatical forms (tense variations, negation, pronouns)
7. Input length variations (short, medium, long)
8. Mixed language content (Singlish + English)
9. Punctuation, numeric formats, and text formatting
10. Informal language and slang

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
  - Verify installation: `node --version`

- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
  - Verify installation: `npm --version`

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

   Or install specific browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   npx playwright install firefox
   npx playwright install webkit
   ```

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
npx playwright test tests/IT23658240 - transliteration.spec.js
```

### Run tests in debug mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Run tests with UI mode (interactive)
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Run tests in specific browser
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

## Viewing Test Reports

### Generate and open HTML report
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

The report will automatically open in your default browser showing:
- Test execution summary
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Screenshots and traces for failed tests
- Detailed execution logs

### View last test report
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Configuration

The `playwright.config.js` file contains the following configurations:

- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per test
- **Retries:** 2 retries on failure (CI environment)
- **Parallel execution:** Tests run in parallel
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Screenshots:** Captured on failure
- **Videos:** Recorded on first retry
- **Trace:** Collected on first retry

## Test Case Naming Convention

Test cases follow the assignment's naming convention:

- **Pos_Fun_XXXX** - Positive functional test cases
- **Neg_Fun_XXXX** - Negative functional test cases
- **Pos_UI_XXXX** - Positive UI test cases
- **Neg_UI_XXXX** - Negative UI test cases

## Expected vs Actual Output Verification

All test cases verify:
1. **Input** - The Singlish text entered
2. **Expected Output** - The correct Sinhala conversion
3. **Actual Output** - The output generated by the system
4. **Status** - Pass/Fail based on comparison


## Excel Test Case Documentation

All test cases are documented in the Excel file using the template format:
- TC ID
- Test case name
- Input length type (S/M/L)
- Input
- Expected output
- Actual output
- Status (Pass/Fail)
- Accuracy justification/Description of issue type
- What is covered by the test

## Additional Notes

- The application performs real-time conversion without requiring a submit button
- Expected outputs are based on the application's Help page for correct Singlish character combinations
- Tests avoid chat-style shorthand (e.g., "Thx", "u", "gr8") as per assignment guidelines
- All test execution results are recorded in the Excel template
